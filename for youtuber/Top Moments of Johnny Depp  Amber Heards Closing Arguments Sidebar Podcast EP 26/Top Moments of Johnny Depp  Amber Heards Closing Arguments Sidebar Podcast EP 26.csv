The interesting part about the crying is that all the newspapers report her as “crying” whilst giving evidence. An inspection of the video of her giving evidence shows absolutely no crying at all…no tears, not one. It’s all an act by a 3rd rate hack actress. A woman who is so possessed with her own hatred for the man who dared to leave her….a classic case of the guilty party pretending to be innocent whilst projecting their own guilt on to the innocent party. A money grabber who lies at every opportunity to get what she has decided she deserves.",10,0

Bob Abooey,"Reports are coming  in from Virginia that the staff of Johnny Depp was unable to awaken him this morning after a night of partying which included drugs and alcohol.

“Where is that box of cocaine and crushed Adderall“, asked one staff member in an effort to revive him.”Did Johnny already snort the whole box”, added the staffer frantically. 

Amber heard is in the process of organizing a vigil for her beloved Johnny Depp. “I forgive him for assaulting me with that bourbon bottle“, Amber said, holding back tears. “I just want him to be here so I can still fight with him“, she added.

Rest in peace Johnny Depp. You will be missed.",2,4

Liz Jones,"I'm so appalled that people are so blinded by bias that they cannot see through the lies and sneakiness of this man! He writes in the most abstract way with 3 exclamation marks or question marks or dots after his sentences, interspersed with certain words in capital letters....and still people are finding reasons to say those texts were not written by him. He also lied about the marks on his face being caused by Amber on their honeymoon when, in actual fact, they were present the day before in the Thailand photos. He tried embarrassingly to claim that the Thailand marks were due to side-lighting. It's cringeworthy. And what a convenient memory problem he has when confronted with evidence against him- didn't write those texts, forgot about asking for Ecstasy and coke, forgot about meeting with The Mail newspaper with Mr Waldman. Oh and, of course, how when a photo didn't portray him in a good light, it must have been photoshopped. And the texts must've been typed up last night by the lawyer. Come on guys, wake up! That's the paranoia of a controlling man and I just don't understand how people can't see that. Not to mention that words like ""c*m guzzler"" and other vile things he's said show a really nasty streak in this guy. Decent people don't repeatedly use that kind of language, even if they've got a horrible spouse. There's a difference between anger and misogynistic rage meted out to all around him that's been shown repeatedly in this case. He is a perfect example of manipulative, devious controller with a carefully crafted ""Nice guy"" persona. He's an entitled, demanding, rage-filled man and, coupled with an out of control drink and drug problem, it's a recipe for disaster. I agree that Amber is also manipulative and has been caught out in lies (and trust me, I do understand what it's like to be in a relationship with a personality-disordered individual), but the disproportionate amount of vitriol towards her is astonishing when evidence of his nastiness is right there too for all to see. She probably did trigger him and push his buttons but I still see no excuse for the hate-filled comments about her. ""F***ing her dead corpse"" is not part of the Monty Python sketch that he's flippantly attributed that text exchange to - that's his little gem that he added to that and it's disgusting no matter how you look at it.  Regardless of whether you like Amber or not, women all around the world, stop turning a blind eye to his sort of behaviour. Stop making excuses for it or you are complicit in perpetuating abusive behaviour towards women. Shame on you.",2,0

Mika Damianos,"Echoing Tolstoy, unhappy marriages so resemble each other and this one was no exception.  There was jealousy, insecurity, mental and emotional cruelty, physical violence, hints of extramarital affairs, drug and alcohol fuelled fights, the same script with altering characters.  The court proceedings have now ended while the jury begins its deliberations, a final verdict to be announced in a few short days.  But this now seems almost perfunctory, besides the point.  As Depp himself conceded at the beginning of the case:  “I’ve lost everything.  No matter the outcome of this trial, I’ve already lost,” but which can be extrapolated to so much else besides.  We have certainly lost time, both personally and collectively, a spectacular investment of legal expertise to this one specific case, resources expended and certainly massive amounts of money paid by each party fighting this out in court, attention drawn elsewhere from raging wars, environment and economic collapses, to name but a few, as we all await a final rendering that may or may not have any real significant consequence.  Perhaps this is yet another mirage, some phantasmagoria of violence and greed, of mental and emotional instability, of doomed love, but with no neat conclusions or deeper understandings as the story will undoubtedly play out at some later time with different characters, a similar narrative, as it has for ages.  Regardless of who “wins”, what might be actual vindication?

Nilufer Okay,Why is the internet so biased on the Depps side? Wasn't he called her so many horrible things like drown her and  f*** her corps? How can this be justified? It's NOT NORMAL!! Doing drugs and alcohol 24/7 is NOT NORMAL!! What's wrong with you people!!,0,0
Nikki D,"Amber Heard was posturing for the Jury the entire time, Blaming her Attorneys for not producing evidence, Unable to match her face to her words. Everyone else's fault. Absolutely Ridiculous and disgusting! Elon Musk is probably trying to buy Twitter for her in case she does get found Guilty for re-tweeting the op-ed with a comment which would fall under publishing laws so she can go back and sue JD for it again",0,0

Nu_Merick,"What really screwed up Amber's case, besides the audio recording and photoshopped photos, was her last cross examination by camille. Camille mentioned every witness to amber and amber just denied all of those claims and says they're liars and even admitted to writting the op-ed about depp.. She's rotten to the core.",0,1

Nancy Wenn,"There is only one part of rottenborn's closing argument that cannot refer to Johnny Depp! - and that's when he refers to a 'him'.  Other than that, everything he says you can turn around and say that's Johnny.   I ask you to listen to him again, only, in your head, pretend he's Johnny's attorney.",0,0

Jayeden Dunahee,Son of god here.   Sorry I’m late Johnny.   Umm ok so.   In 2022 the fact she has zero photo evidence no hidden cameras catching him hit her says he’s innocent.  It’s very easy to catch ppl on hidden cams they can be so small.  Kate says no.  And ya.  She’s a liar.  Give Johnny the money.  This is done.   Also.  Hunter says hi.&  Nice hat.  :).,0,0

Royal Broman,"People need to start understanding there is an invisible war between energy happening that dwells in the male and female that's been discussed in every religion in every region in one way or another better seen as the Ying and Yang. To tell it today these energys could be better recognized as the logic and the feeling. Males are the self or the individual, wile female's are connected through feeling having a universal face underneath the personality. Witch is why women threw out time have been seen as coming from male, or the clone, or the 2. Do to the universal face of feeling connecting them, that can be seen on the biological scale threw the gender itself. This also explains the difference between male and female threw ""progression"". Though men are not blameless and have created tyrants such as Hitler or Stalin. The male energy or ""individual"" is willing to rebell against itself to correct itself. Causing rebellion from within and around there organizations. Showing progression to free slaves, give women rights, and take our species multi plant and take us to Mars. Female dose not have this characteristic and are more selfish in nature then properly explained in this day in age explaining why they have only been able to progress itself even after 100 years of being out of their ""Oppression"". While using male energy to protect itself without giving anything in return. Again is why inside all women whether good or bad, the individual is always made to take the feeling. Yet feeling desires both. Showing the paradox of female the contradiction in feeling. This is also why threw out time in every religion female was never made to be in judgment. Even though now a days Judges are more female then male corrupting law male created. You can see that when the first female entered the justice system as a judge in the 1920's. Law slowly changed from logical arguments to magical words. Pushing the agenda of female confusion to all who comes under their judgment. Wile they preach its OK to change genders or how it's their body's to kill their kids no matter how far along they are. Instead of male self acceptance or life energy. Feeling was never made to rule itself, and women would be happier for it. The contradiction in confusion is not made to rule this world the individual of progression is. This is why we have single handedly destroyed humanity. Slowly without anyone knowing. This can also be seen through percentages witch should answer most questions. Our only hope I see for male's to pass this test is to cut off marriage as a whole, and do better logical vetting testing practices for Judges, wile doing the best to keep our male children with the male energy and females to their female energy.",0,0
